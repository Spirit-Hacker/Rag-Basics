Generative AI models generate new text, images, or code using patterns learned from training data. Large Language Models process text using transformer architectures.

RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, improves accuracy by combining an LLM with external knowledge sources. The system retrieves relevant text chunks and adds them as context to the model during generation.

Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors that represent meaning. Semantic search compares embeddings to find the most relevant information for a query.

Fine-tuning modifies model weights using domain-specific data. Prompt engineering shapes the model’s behavior without changing the weights.

Agentic workflows allow LLMs to call tools, browse the web, and interact with APIs. They use planning, memory, and action loops to execute multi-step tasks.

Tokenization breaks text into smaller pieces so the model can process it. Attention mechanisms let the model focus on important parts of the input.

Generative models evaluate output based on probability distribution over tokens. Temperature controls randomness. Lower values make the model deterministic.

Safety techniques like guardrails, content filtering, and grounding reduce hallucinations and ensure the model stays aligned with user intent.
