Three.js is a JavaScript library used to render 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It simplifies creating scenes, cameras, lights, materials, and geometries.

A Scene is the container that holds 3D objects. A PerspectiveCamera simulates human eye perspective. WebGLRenderer draws the scene on a canvas at every frame.

Geometries define shapes such as BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, or custom shapes. Materials like MeshBasicMaterial or MeshStandardMaterial define how objects appear.

Lighting is essential for realistic rendering. Common lights include AmbientLight, PointLight, DirectionalLight, and SpotLight.

The render loop uses requestAnimationFrame to update animations. Objects can rotate, move, or respond to user interactions.

Textures add detail to surfaces. Environment maps create reflections. Normal maps simulate surface bumps without adding geometry.

Shaders allow custom control of how vertices and fragments are processed. Vertex shaders modify position of vertices. Fragment shaders control pixel color. ShaderMaterial enables writing GLSL for advanced effects.

OrbitControls let users rotate, zoom, and pan the camera. Post-processing adds effects such as bloom, depth of field, and color grading.
