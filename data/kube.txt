Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers into units called Pods, which are the smallest deployable object.

A Deployment ensures that the desired number of Pod replicas are always running. If a Pod fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it.

Services expose Pods using stable networking. ClusterIP exposes Pods inside the cluster, NodePort exposes to external traffic, and LoadBalancer integrates with cloud load balancers.

ConfigMaps store configuration data separately from code. Secrets store sensitive information like passwords and tokens.

The Kubernetes control plane includes the API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, and etcd database. Worker nodes run the container runtime, kubelet, and kube-proxy.

Kubernetes uses declarative configuration. You describe the desired state in YAML files, and the control plane continually works to match the actual state to the desired state.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler increases or decreases replicas based on CPU or custom metrics. StatefulSets are used for applications requiring stable network identities and persistent storage.

kubectl is the CLI tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Common commands include: kubectl get, kubectl apply, kubectl describe, and kubectl logs.
