Docker is a tool that packages applications into isolated environments called containers. A container includes the application code, runtime, dependencies, and configurations. Containers run the same way on any system that supports Docker.

Images are the blueprint for containers. An image is built using a Dockerfile, which contains instructions like base image, files to copy, commands to run, and exposed ports.

Docker uses a layered filesystem where each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. Layers are cached to speed up rebuilds.

A container is a running instance of an image. Containers are lightweight because they use the host operating system kernel instead of running a full virtual machine.

The Docker daemon manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. The Docker CLI communicates with the daemon using the Docker API.

Volumes allow containers to store persistent data outside the container lifecycle. Bind mounts let you map local folders into containers during development.

Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to declare services, networks, and volumes.

Common commands include: docker build, docker run, docker logs, docker exec, docker ps, docker pull, and docker push.
